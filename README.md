## Mini-Projects
Various mini data science projects utilizing skills in machine learning, NLP, scikit-learn, pandas and more

## Satellite Communications:
Total sattelites launched into orbit by year: quick notebook using the UCS sattelites database and our world in data to show the number of sattelites launched per year and total number orbiting earth per year. This is has a huge impact on ground based astrophysical observations and is a growing concern in the community. The final plot in this notebook was produced to include in my PhD thesis (Polaris) for illustration of the problem

Data for yearly number of objects launched is obtained from our world in data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space

## Time series forecasting:
The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate the use of machine learning to forecast temperatures given a time series input

## CNN image classification using tensorflow

## NLP star rating predictions using user reviews:

Notebook showing NLP cabability in scikit-learn to predict user review star ratings based on review text. Also shows a method for calculating the 10 key words most likely to indicate a negative review
