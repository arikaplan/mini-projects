## Mini-Projects
Various mini data science projects utilizing skills in machine learning, NLP, scikit-learn, pandas and more

## NLP star rating predictions using user reviews:

Notebook showing NLP cabability in scikit-learn to predict user review star ratings based on review text. An ensemble regression model is implemented as well as investigations into models using Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and a random forest classifier.

I also perform sentiment analysis using a naive bayes model for calculating key polarizing words most likely to indicate a negative or positive review.

## CNN image classification using tensorflow

Short notebook to show method of image classification using tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capability, as well as the ability to implement transfer learning using a network already trained on color images (Inception network). Classification data is obtained from the The CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Time series forecasting:
The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate the use of machine learning to forecast temperatures given a time series input.
Regression is done on both a one hot encoder and fourier model approach, with performance quantified by $R^2$ values.

## Querying NYC resturaunt inspection data using SQL
Notebook showing the process of querying NYC resturaunt inspection data using SQL. Two examples are given, one to group resturaunts by borough and show average score per borough, and one to group by cuisine type and show the number of violations per cuisine type within a given time period

## Satellite Communications:
Total sattelites launched into orbit by year: quick notebook using the UCS sattelites database and our world in data to show the number of sattelites launched per year and total number orbiting earth per year. This is has a huge impact on ground based astrophysical observations and is a growing concern in the community. The final plot in this notebook was produced to include in my PhD thesis (Polaris) for illustration of the problem

Data for yearly number of objects launched is obtained from our world in data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space

Data for yearly number of satellites launched is obtained from UCS satellite database: https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database
